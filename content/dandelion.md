>What does the future of chocolate tasting look like?
Dandelion Chocolate is a San Francisco-based chocolate company, focused on crafting single-origin chocolate bars. 

Currently, all their storefronts  have a long line of tasting dishes, and customers tend to be uncertain on how to taste or what they're looking for. My work for Dandelion provided actionable proposals for improvements to their in-store and online tasting experiences.

## My contributions

Although I completed this project on my own, I worked alongside six other students working for Dandelion as they designed for retail pop ups, advent calendar, and factory uniform design. 

In this specific project, notable parts of my main design process included:

## Research into tasting experiences
To fully grasp the client problem space, I held **two initial stakeholder interviews with Elaine from Dandelion.** In the first, I learned more about her thoughts on the store experience, and in the second, we dove into specifics on how her survey worked and how it could be translated to other platforms. Additionally, I hosted **informal interviews with two classmates who were previous customers** in San Francisco. 

Learning more about the curated tasting experience, I conducted a **competitive analysis to learn from various ‚Äòtasting‚Äô experiences** across teas, soaps, books, and perfumes. Additionally, I documented current ‚Äòpick your product‚Äô surveys that allow customers to find product preferences, looking for key survey techniques.

From my research, some notable touchpoints came out: 

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Too much information to process üòµ‚Äçüí´</div>
  In stores, users have a lot of information to process when going through self-guided tasting experiences, which are often set up with upwards of 8 tasting possibilities all at once.
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Valued custom recommendations üíå</div>
  Overall, online product surveys allow each company to tailor their product recommendations to each user, and were viewed as a great way to match personal preferences with a product. 
  </div>
</div>

Then, synthesizing these findings, I began to map out the current and potential future user flows.

Overall, the improvements in the future user flow stemmed from these design requirements:

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Too much information to process ‚Üí</div>
  One of my goals was to provide the informational experience in bite-size pieces for users.
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Valued custom recommendations ‚Üí</div>
  The other goal was to allow Dandelion to gather and utilize flavor valuable profile data, facilitating their engagement with customer data.
  </div>
</div>

## Ideating a range of concepts
Based on the set user needs, I then began to sketch out concepts for improvements. My initial ideation took two forms, through hand-drawn sketches and wireframes. At this stage, I presented my initial ideas to other student collaborators, gathering feedback on concepts and design sensibilities.

## Prototyping across digital & physical mediums 
After gathering feedback and narrowing down to an intended solution, I began to create physical artifacts and prototypes on Figma to convey my concepts. For the physical prototypes, I used a combination of fabrication methods, including:

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">3D printed faceplate</div>
    To hold the comparison info at a 45 degree angle for easy viewing from afar.  
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Paper-based insert</div>
    To make sure the comparison block was reusable if store layouts changed.
  </div>
    <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Laser cut/engraved tasting steps</div>
    Once customers are close to the block, they can read through tasting steps to learn more about the chocolate flavors.
  </div>
</div>

## Validating through a student activity
As a class demo, I set up each of my three leading concepts. I walked students through each intended experience, and observed as they interacted with the prototypes. At this stage, my goal was to provide a proof of concept and light validation with these solutions.

## Final concept
The final experiences presented to Dandelion included 3 tracks:

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Low lift</div>
    An update to the web experience to introduce online-orders to a re-branded digital survey.
  </div>
    <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Medium lift</div>
  A set up of intentional tasting stations across for users to follow along with their phones.
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">High lift</div>
  A set up of self-guided tasting stations with in-store tablets.
  </div>
</div>

## Low lift for tasting online orders

## Medium lift for intentional guided comparisons

## High lift for self-guided tastings

## Food for thought
This work was presented to Dandelion in February of 2025 along with all the student teams. We got great feedback from the broader team at Dandelion, who is excited to explore these concepts more. Reflecting on this work, I'm excited about the potential ideas brought to the team, but would love to further explore a few concepts. 

Specifically, I'd be interested in:
1. Contextual inquiry: With the opportunity to be in person at their stores, I would love to run some observation sessions to learn from customers as they go through current/prototyped tasting experiences. 
2. Production & portability: One of my next steps for this project would be to look into the cost for each experience to be implemented across multiple storefronts and pop-ups.
