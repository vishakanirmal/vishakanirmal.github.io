>Why alter group fitness classes?
Group fitness classes are not just a place for exercise, but also a space of community and synchronization. Throughout the wide variety of fitness classes, instructors primarily rely on audio and visual cues to direct their participants. With this project, we introduce a new alternative cue: haptic communication, streamlining accessibility for those who are Deaf or hard of hearing.

This project was guided by our connections at RIT, including:
- Matthew Dye, Graduate Program Director in Cognitive Science
- Skip Flanagan, Athletic Coordinator & Deaf athlete
- Amy Stornello, Title IX coordinator & hard of hearing/Deaf yoga instructor

Although my focus was on interaction design, throughout this project I was able to contribute to the IoT software and hardware engineering, form design, and exhibition design. We crafted our prototypes out of 3D printed and silicone molded parts, and used a variety of Arduino and Raspberry Pi based microcontrollers. This case study is in progress, but read more about my design process and view some pictures from the project below:
