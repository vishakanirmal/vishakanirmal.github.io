## About the project
This project was my first collaboration in the Brown/RISD Masters of Design Engineering program, involving market research, user studies, product ideation, and prototyping. The outcome was a **textile-board furniture prototype** paired with a **digital narrative tracing its origins**. This approach combines recycled materials with a digital storytelling platform to promote long-term product use and reduce waste.

This project will be presented at the **ACM Tangible and Embedded Information Conference** in Bordeaux, France, in March 2025. 


## Context
**11.3 million tons of textile waste and 12 million tons of furniture waste end up in U.S. landfills annually.** Only 1% of textiles are recycled into new clothing; 75% end up in landfills. The rise of fast fashion and fast furniture has contributed to disposable consumer behavior. As a team, we set off to tackle these problems. 

Weft builds on the work of projects like Fabbrick and Remembermechair by upcycling textiles into functional, emotionally resonant furniture.

## Role
The team contributed equally, but some of my notable contributions were:
- **Material prototyping** to create durable, upcycled boards.
- **Interactivity ideation** to facilitate user interactions.

## Research
We surveyed **51 participants** and conducted **11 semi-structured interviews** to understand sustainability attitudes and emotional attachment to objects.

Key insights:
- Average interest in sentimental products: **6.34/10**.
- Emotional connection stems from items that **"memorialize cherished moments."**

Our research identified the need for a product that:
1. **Fosters emotional connections** by sharing the story behind materials.
2. **Encourages sustainability** through durable, upcycled designs.

## Ideation
We pursued two tracks:
1. **Furniture design** reflecting the textile materialsâ€™ history.
2. **Digital experience** to deepen emotional connections.

We used **sketching** and **emotional mapping** to guide the process.

## Prototyping the Physical Product
- Developed **textile boards** by combining shredded fabric with resin.
- Scaled from **small molds** to larger boards using **240 lbs of pressure**.
- Resulted in a durable material suitable for furniture.

## Prototyping the Digital Experience
- Built a **user journey map** to identify emotional connection points.
- Developed wireframes into **high-fidelity mockups**.
- Created a platform where users can:
  - **Scan a QR code** embedded in the furniture.
  - Access the **digital story** of their product's journey.

## Final Concept
The final product:
- Combines **customizable furniture** with a **digital narrative**.
- Encourages **long-term use** by making each piece personal and meaningful.

**How it works:**
1. Users select textiles for their furniture.
2. A QR code provides access to a **storytelling platform**, sharing the transformation journey from waste to product.

## Future Work
We aim to improve:
1. **Adhesives**: Transitioning from resin to **bio-based alternatives** (e.g., lignin-based adhesives).
2. **Material durability**: Enhancing weather resistance and load capacity.
3. **Scalability**: Personalizing digital stories for large-scale production.
4. **Community engagement**: Developing a platform for users to share experiences and connect over sustainability.
