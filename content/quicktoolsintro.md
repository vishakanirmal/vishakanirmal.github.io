## About the work
In this project, I worked to help Lucid uplevel their template capabilities, by designing **dynamic canvas widgets that allow ease of tool access**. The goal of this work was to increase user engagement with our initial point of contact-- templates.  

I worked as the Lead Designer for this work, taking my team's winning hackathon project to director and C-Suite level strategic conversations. The final work can be seen [live on any Lucid platform](https://x.com/LucidSoftware/status/1804213038121115850?lang=en).
