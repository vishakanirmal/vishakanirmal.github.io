### Context
In 2023, I pitched a winning Hackathon project to build on-canvas widgets for Lucid‚Äôs virtual canvas tools. Following my team's 1st place finish, I then led strategic efforts to integrate the feature across our product suite. This work resulted in a toolkit of 30+ Quick Tools, **released to all 100 million Lucid users, and is now embedded in over 75% of Lucid templates.** You can now try this feature out [on any Lucid platform](https://x.com/LucidSoftware/status/1804213038121115850?lang=en).
