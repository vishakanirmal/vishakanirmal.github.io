## About the work
In this student capstone project, partnered with Microsoft Dynamics 365, we were tasked with redesigning the Field Service Application. Our goal was to **improve how field service technicians create, manage, and find resources**.

Throughout this project, my student team and I worked directly with Microsoft to research, design, and handoff solutions for their team. The final deliverable included a proof of concept for a mobile-AR powered application to help technicians find and track information recorded at a jobsite.
