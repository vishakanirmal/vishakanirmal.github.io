>How can Lucid products better support and streamline team decision-making?
Visual Activities is a new, dynamic surveying tool that can be created, edited, and launched, all from the virtual canvas. Throughout this project, I helped to design key flows within the Visual Activities feature, including the on-canvas shape and results. **This feature launched to all users in May 2023, and now has an average of 28,000 users each month.**

Although I worked as the lead designer for my scrum team, I worked closely with 2 designers, Saurabh Phadnis and Casey Robinson, who worked on other parts of the feature on sister teams. In this specific project, notable parts of my main design process included:

## Why create a surveying tool?
Lucid users often sought better ways to gather and visualize team feedback. In an online canvas, active collaborators can easily contribute to the discussion by adding shapes and sticky notes. However when making decisions, it becomes difficult to gather everyone’s perspective. A single decision maker may not capture everyone’s thoughts. 

![Problems with all editing together](../src/images/visualactivities/Current.png)


## Market research & requirements
When starting this project, I worked closely with a tiger team (3 designers and 3 product managers across teams) to synthesize research from our Marketing and Strategic teams. We set up our aligning key requirements and capabilities for the solution:

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Gather</div>
Create a reusable, dynamic way to gather feedback from a team.
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Organize</div>
Allow participants to easily organize their thoughts visually. 
  </div>
    <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Analyze</div>
Provide collaborators with digestible, actionable results. 
  </div>
</div>

## Initial concept
Based on the feature's ideal requirements and capabiltiies, we set to create a space on the canvas to gather, organize, and analyze feedback. Ideally, the new feature would allow each participant to individually 'respond' by adjusting content in their own private canvas. 
![The initial concept](../src/images/visualactivities/Synthesis.png)

## Ideation and sketches
As we refined the concept, some of the key features we needed to design for included: 
<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">How do I use this shape on the canvas?</div>
We needed to make the on-canvas experience distinct and understandable.
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">What happens with my data after the activity?</div>
We needed to understand how to visually showcase this data well. 
  </div>
</div>

Here are a few of my early sketches for the on-canvas shape and results visualizations:

## Collaborative concept refinement
I helped lead various cross-functional meetings to ideate creative solutions to some of the complex technical constraints of on-canvas surveying. Here are examples of a design jam I led with the UX team (about 20 designers at the time), and a 'solutioning' meeting I led with my scrum team's engineers to discuss possibilities for the results visualizations.

## Validation through user testing
Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to conduct many moderated validation with existing Lucid users under an NDA. These interviews helped to continously refine my mocks and prototypes. I was also able to host larger scale usability testing through UserTesting.com, where I would create unmoderated prototype tests and gather feedback from 10-20 participants at a time. Some of the specific testing surrounded:

<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">The on-canvas shape</div>
Did users know how to edit and launch each activity on the canvas?
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Participation</div>
Once in the activity, how did they know to interact with the right objects? 
  </div>
    <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Results</div>
After finishing an activity, how did users analyze and use the results?
  </div>
</div>

Within the results testing, I led a specific effort to design, prototype, and test how categorical activities would display results. Here's an example of this feedback on the UserTesting platform:

![Example of testing on UserTesting.com](../src/images/visualactivities/Validation.png)

The various sources of user feedback provided many insights on specific improvements for our designs. Some of the notable takeaways for each part of the feature included: 
<div class="info-container">
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">The on-canvas shape</div>
The on-canvas shape was easy and inviting for participants to click the launch button, but users often had trouble editing their activities to their liking.  
  </div>
  <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Participation</div>
Sometimes, participants didn't know how to interact with a survey, unsure which elements were interactive once they entered their private canvas. 
  </div>
    <div class="info-block">
   <div class="info-title">Results</div>
Once users got to results, we saw that they wanted a quick overview of all responses, but also wanted to be able to dive into each individual's response to understand the spread of opinions better. 
  </div>
</div>


## Final Designs
This feature, Visual Activities, officially launched in May 2023. We've continued refining the feature based on our user feedback, but the basis for Visual Activities allows users to create, deploy, and analyze surveys straight from their canvas. My key contributions for this solution include the on-canvas shape, participation experience, and the results experience. 

## On-canvas shape
The on-canvas activity shape has two states: an 'edit mode' for setup and a 'participation mode' for user interaction. In edit mode, users can drag content into the shape, preparing it for participant interaction. Once editing is complete, the shape transforms, inviting collaborators to engage.

## Responding to the survey
Participants enter their own mini-canvas, where they interact with the shapes to provide their responses. The design ensures clarity, with participants always aware of their active participation through visual cues like avatars and responsive objects.

## Results visualizations
The results visualization showcases each participant's input in relation to the group's average response. This interactive data visualization allows teams to quickly understand consensus or divergence in opinions, enhancing the decision-making process.

## Outcomes
Visual Activities launched to all Lucid users in May 2023 and quickly gained traction as a powerful tool for collaborative decision-making, now with over 150,000 uses each month. The iterative design process proved invaluable, allowing us to refine ideas rapidly and deliver a feature that meets user needs effectively. 

I had the opportunity to present use cases for this tool alongside my team during one of Lucid's webinars. [Watch the presentation here!](https://lucid.co/resources/webinars/use-cases-for-visual-activities-jan-2024)
