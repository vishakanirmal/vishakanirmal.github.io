> Building an infinite canvas toolkit for Lucid's smart templates. 
![Hero image of quick tools](../src/images/quicktools/hero.png)

## Background 
> Starting with a blank canvas can be daunting

Lucid had a robust library of canvas templates, from mind maps to cloud architecture diagrams. My task was to enhance Lucid’s smart template capabilities, enabling users to quickly leverage the tool’s features directly from these templates.

| Time     | Tools     | Design team      |
|:---------|:----------|:----------|
| 6 months | Figma     | Vishaka   |
|          | Lucidspark |    |
|          |   Maze        |      |

## Concept
> A winning hackathon project led to this game-changing feature.

The concept for Quick Tools was born during Lucid’s 2023 hackathon, where my team and I developed the initial iterations of shape banks and action buttons. Our project won first place in the "Build to Delight" category.

Post-hackathon, I led UX strategy, user research, and design for the Quick Tools feature, which officially launched to all Lucid users in June 2024.

## Research
> Although there was internal reception to this project, we needed to understand if this was valuable with our users.

During the hackathon, user research conducted by Erin Lilly quickly validated our idea. One product manager remarked that the tools “helped participants focus on content rather than learning how to use the tool.”

After the hackathon, I led continous user interviews with paid, free, and enterprise users at Lucid to understand their needs with smart templates. Our main findings were that:
- New users found it hard to find the tools they need
- Experienced users wanted to help get their team up to speed using a digital whiteboard

## Strategy
> I led a number of discussions to align our design, engineering, and product leaders and stakeholders.

Following our hackathon success, I led discussions with Product, UX, and Marketing leadership to secure investment in shape banks and quick actions. Using our research and internal testing, we demonstrated that these tools would:

- Accelerate individual and team workflows.
- Enhance discoverability of features on the canvas.
- Enable facilitators to curate focused participation experiences.

## Iteration
> Through design iteration, my work defined the new problem space of UI on the canvas

With leadership buy-in, I collaborated with a new development team to further develop Quick Tools. Our objective was to increase template utilization by refining and expanding the tools.

Working closely with my product manager, James Webb, we outlined our goals and roadmap. I created high-level concept mocks and detailed designs to transition Quick Tools from its hackathon state to a polished product.

## Validation
> With user interviews, observation sessions, and usability testing, we refined quick tools in an agile development cycle.

Beyond initial hackathon research, I conducted three major research initiatives, including usability testing and participatory design exercises. 

In addition to formal studies, I regularly engaged with users through weekly calls to gather feedback and insights, which informed continuous improvements to the product.

## Final Designs
> Quick shape banks allow users to quickly add from a pre-built library of shapes, directly from the canvas. 

Our research guided the development of widgets that allowed users to create and reuse shapes easily. We emphasized intuitive design, like stackable items in the shape bank and customizable shape banks for personalized use.

> Quick actions act as buttons on the canvas to easily find and activate necessary tools. 
Quick actions were designed to be simple yet effective, with buttons on the canvas that users could easily understand and interact with. I refined interactions to ensure a seamless user experience, including precise hover and padding states.

> With this encompassing tool, how would users access them?
The entry point for Quick Tools in Lucidspark and Lucidchart was another critical design. Initially, I proposed a gallery-like experience, but after testing, we opted for a list-panel approach, which proved more successful in A/B testing.

## Outcomes
> Since the launch, we've seen over 100,000 uses of quick tools each month.   

Quick Tools launched in June 2024 and was prominently featured in Lucid’s "June Lately" webinar, showcasing the impact of our work on enhancing user experience.
