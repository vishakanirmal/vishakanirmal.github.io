## About the work
Throughout this project, I worked on a brand new feature for the Lucid suite of products, allowing teams to easily gather opinions and align on decisions. The result was a dynamic, on-canvas polling tool that allows Lucid collaborators to create, deploy, gather, and analyze surveys. This work was part of a strategic initiative to **help teams make collaborative decisions on the virtual canvas.** 

I worked as a lead designer for one of the 3 development teams working on this feature. I worked closely with 2 other designers, Saurabh Phadnis and Casey Robinson throughout this project. The final work can be seen live on any Lucid platform, and you can view a webinar I helped host about the feature [here.](https://lucid.co/resources/webinars/use-cases-for-visual-activities-jan-2024)
