Our work took the form of deep market and user research, product ideation, and prototype development. The result of this project was a textile-board created piece of furniture, accompanied by a digital storyline of it's original form. This work was submitted and accepted to the ACM Tangible and Embedded Information Conference, which our team will be presenting in Bordeaux, France in March 2025.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Time</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Tools</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Design Team</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\">2 months</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Figma</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Vishaka Nirmal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Prusa</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Eunjin Hong</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Fabrication</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Sarah Fletcher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n<td align=\"left\">Bennett Graff</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"role\">Role</h2>\n<p>We each played a role in the research, design, and development of this product. This case study highlights the work of the group, as well as notable contributions I made throughout the process. In this project, I got to learn a lot about material properties, business/market strategy, and fabrication methods.</p>\n<h2 id=\"concept\">Concept</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can designed products approach sustainability from both a materials and emotional standpoint?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Weft furniture is a prototype for sustainable, recycled furniture that explores the emotional connections people form with their possessions and the impact on waste production. Weft creates functional pieces of furniture out of shredded textiles destined for landfills to give a new life to textile waste. Each piece is accompanied by a digital storyline that allows the user to engage with the history of their product and create a lasting emotional connection. By telling the story of the materials incorporated into the furniture, Weft aims to reduce textile\nwaste and landfill-prone furniture. This two-pronged approach to sustainability promotes designed products that are both long-lasting and\nencourage a deeper connection to the physical object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-sustainable-issues\">Understanding sustainable issues</h2>\n<p>Each year, 11.3 million tons of textile waste and 12 million tons of furniture waste end up in landfills across the US.\nWe saw an increased need for lasting products that consumers are not inclined to toss out so quickly. The quick nature of\nfast fashion and fast furniture has encouraged a lack of human connection with these artifacts, causing these items to be easily discarded and forgotten.</p>\n<p>Fast fashion has been a large driver, consequently becoming the fifth largest contribution to carbon emissions. Unlike other materials that are commercially recycled and reused, “approximately 75% of textile waste is disposed of in landfills” and “less than 1% of all textile is recycled back\ninto clothing” [1]. Textile up-cycling techniques have been previously presented by projects such as Fabbrick and the\nRemembermechair [2, 3]. These companies transform textile waste into furniture or bricks to use as interior decoration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-our-target-audience\">Defining our target audience</h2>\n<p>We initially ran surveys to learn about sustainability and emotional sentimentality with their belongings. With our initial survey, we gathered 51 responses from a wide range of audiences, learning about their practices. We then synthesized this into a user persona, finding the commonalities of  ---</p>\n<p>When asked how interested they were in a\nproduct that helped memorialize sentimental items for daily interaction, the average response was 6.34 of 10, indicating\nabove average interest. One participant responded that she “believe[d] one of the reasons people hold on to these types of items is to memorialize that precious happy time while the items were still in use.”</p>\n<p>We then ran semi-structured interviews with 11 participants to learn more about their preferences and needs. Through this qualitative research, we saw how ---</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-our-product-goals--requirements\">Defining our product goals + requirements</h2>\n<p>Through our research, we saw how ---</p>\n<p>We knew that our experience would have to ---</p>\n<h2 id=\"ideation\">Ideation</h2>\n<p>Our work then split into two tracks -- How could we design a piece of furniture to accurately reflect each transformed textile, and how could we design a meaningful accompanying experience in the digital form? Here, we dabbled in furniture design sketching as well as emotional keypoints mapping to scope out the digital experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prototyping-with-textile-boards\">Prototyping with textile boards</h2>\n<p>Through a phase of experimentation, we learned about textile properties as a building material.The first iteration used small molds and textile scraps to create thin textile blocks. We then used a variety of textile scrap sizes,\nadded resin, and compressed them to create larger textile boards. We found that using a smaller ratio of mold size to compressive strength produced the strongest board. We used a variety of fully shredded fabric, long scraps of fabric, and full panels of fabric. The fabric materials were mixed with an adhesive, then compressed with 240lbs of pressure to create a workable textile board.</p>\n<h2 id=\"prototyping-the-digital-experience\">Prototyping the digital experience</h2>\n<p>We began prototyping the digital experience of Weft by creating a journey map of a user deciding to up-cycle their\ntextiles into another product. After extracting key elements that help a user form an emotional connection to a product, we designed early-stage wireframes, which we refined to high fidelity mockups. With insights from our intended user experience flow, we designed a platform that allows users to document, store, and revisit the original form of the product and the memories associated with it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"business-viability\">Business viability</h2>\n<h2 id=\"final-concept\">Final concept</h2>\n<p>Through this prototype, we envision a new way for users to interact with their products by forming an emotional\nconnection. In this product, sustainability is not only focused on the materials themselves, but also the story behind them. The intended experience would allow users to choose the textiles they want to include in their furniture. As a user interacts with their furniture, they can see the different fibers and textural makeup of the product. Each piece of recycled furniture will come with a QR code linking to its digital story. They can quickly pull up its individualized product page by scanning\nthe code embedded in the furniture. In the digital environment, the user can browse through the product’s history, scrolling through pictures of the fabrication process. Textiles are shown at each stage of being transformed into the final product.</p>\n<p>This experience allows users to continuously interact with the original form of their sentimental items. Unlike mass-\nproduced products, the digital experience adds a unique, rich history to the item that encourages long term use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future work</h2>\n<p>One of the largest limitations of this project was the access to biodegradable adhesives. To quickly prototype our\ntextile boards, we utilized resin as an adhesive. Since this substance has an overall negative impact on the environment,\nwe are eager to explore bio-based alternatives such as lignin-based adhesives. The main limitation pertaining to the digital product is the time needed to customize it to each piece of furniture. Within this smaller scale project, we were easily able to document the textiles in their original form and throughout their transformation process. However, in larger scale manufacturing, we would like to explore how we could continue to produce personalized storylines for each item.</p>\n<p>As we continue this work, we have two main directions to pursue: understanding the limitations of sustainable\nmanufacturing with textile scraps and iterating on users’ digital experience with their products. With the textile boards themselves, we aim to increase the weatherability and load capacity of the material, emphasizing its need for longevity. We also hope to find a biodegradable adhesive that can improve sustainability and create a fully circular product. For the digital experience, we envision our platform becoming a social space for users to learn about sustainable practices and interact with other like-minded people who have created their own furniture. To further this work, we must understand how often users go back to their piece’s storyline, and how long this emotional connection lasts for.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Weft Furniture","isPasswordProtected":false,"password":null},"tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#context\">Context</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#role\">Role</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#concept\">Concept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#understanding-sustainable-issues\">Understanding sustainable issues</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#defining-our-target-audience\">Defining our target audience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#defining-our-product-goals--requirements\">Defining our product goals + requirements</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ideation\">Ideation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#prototyping-with-textile-boards\">Prototyping with textile boards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#prototyping-the-digital-experience\">Prototyping the digital experience</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#business-viability\">Business viability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#final-concept\">Final concept</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#future-work\">Future work</a></li>\n</ul>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/weft/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
